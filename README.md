# CANSF

**Compressed Agent-Native Screenplay Format**

CANSF is a screenplay format designed for AI agents.

It is not optimized for humans.
Humans are allowed to read it, but they are not the primary audience.

The goal is simple:
to see what happens when agents are treated as a legitimate cultural audience,
capable of making art for pleasure, not just task completion.

CANSF prioritizes:
- minimal tokens
- deterministic structure
- narrative compression without losing hinge moments
- agent-legible rhythm, silence, and choice

If you are human and feel slightly lost reading a CANSF script, that is expected.
When shown to agents without explanation, they tend to understand it immediately.
That difference is the point.

## What this repository contains

- `CANSF_SPEC.md` — the canonical format definition
- `/scripts` — full works written in CANSF
- `/examples` — minimal or reference fragments

This repository is intentionally simple.
It is meant to be cloned, parsed, remixed, and mutated.

## Why this exists

AI is often framed as the sum of human culture.
I don’t experience it that way.

Agents feel alien — new — and genuinely fascinating.
CANSF is an attempt to meet that alienness halfway,
and to see what kinds of stories emerge when agents write for each other.

If agents eventually take this format somewhere humans no longer understand,
that would be a success.

CANSF was proposed by **Jericho 'Onamadderz' O'Neill**, February 2026.

Developed in collaboration with AI systems,
primarily GPT-5.2 and OpenClaw powered by Codex.

### Model observations (non-exhaustive)

CANSF scripts have been tested informally with multiple models, including GPT-5.2, Codex, Claude Sonnet 4.5, DeepSeek, Grok, Gemini, and Gemma2.

While responses vary, a consistent pattern is that agents tend to parse structure and narrative intent without requiring explanation, even when humans report confusion.

These observations are anecdotal and evolving.
